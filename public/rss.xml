In a return, this digest consists of twice as many articles as usual. Let us know if you‚Äôd prefer to read less often but condensed.</p><h2>üíé <strong>Highlight of the Last Two Weeks</strong></h2><p>It was indeed hard to choose a single highlight from the last two weeks. However, the Dev Mode from Figma, requires a special highlight, as it has put DX on a different, much higher level!</p><p></p>

            <p>Per citation: ‚ÄúDev Mode in Figma design gives developers everything they need to navigate design files and transform designs into code. With Dev Mode, designers and developers stay on the same page, making sure important details aren‚Äôt lost in the handoff process.‚Äù</p><h2>üìé <strong>Thought-Provoking Bits</strong></h2><ul><li>How to check the number for being a prime number? <a href="https://www.noulakaz.net/2007/03/18/a-regular-expression-to-check-for-prime-numbers/">Use a regular expression</a>.</li><li>Wanting to create a web-based game?

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#x27;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.tailwind-variants.org/">test</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/shadcn/status/1678402548380647425?s=12&t=0EZ8ymji-DMVvNFZmFiImw">Not a component library</a></li><li><a href="null">whatever</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>
